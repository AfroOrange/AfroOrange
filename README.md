# Hi there, I'm Nuha 👋


🌱 About me, I'm currently studying a degree in Application Development. I'm a Python and Java enthusiast, and I've done a lot of JavaFX Projects throughout my student years.

🔭 I'm looking for an opportunity as an Application Developer. Although I'm interested in this area, I'm a passionate learner and I want to keep exploring other fields involved with programming.

🖥️ During my free time, I enjoy spending time learning about new hardware, being up to date in new techonologies is a big trait of mine.

⭐ In the near future, I'd like to work in personal projects such as Kotlin or Java developing for Android Apps including certain areas such as videogames, which I'm also into. 

☕ I like cats, oranges, and coffee :)
