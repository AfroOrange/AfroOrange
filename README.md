# Hi there, I'm Nuha ðŸ‘‹


I'm currently studying a degree in Application Development. I'm a Python enthusiast, but I've done a lot of Java Projects throughout my student years, specifically in the UI field working with JavaFX.
That being said, I'm looking for an Application Developer job as well as a Data Analyst, given my experience with Databases such as SQL and Firebase.
